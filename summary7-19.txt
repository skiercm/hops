# HOPS Linux Mint Docker Repository Troubleshooting Summary
## Date: July 19, 2025

### Problem Description
HOPS installation failing on Linux Mint 22.1 with Docker repository error:
```
E: The repository 'https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xia Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- Linux Mint uses its own codenames (e.g., "xia" for version 22.1)
- Docker repositories are structured around Ubuntu codenames (e.g., "noble", "jammy", "focal")
- HOPS was using `lsb_release -cs` which returns "xia" instead of the Ubuntu base codename
- Docker doesn't have a repository for Linux Mint's "xia" codename

### System Information (Linux Mint 22.1)
```
Distributor ID: LinuxMint
Description: Linux Mint 22.1
Release: 22.1
Codename: xia
UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble (from /etc/os-release)
```

### Troubleshooting Steps Attempted

#### 1. Initial Fix Attempt (Commit af57a77)
**Files Modified:** `privileged-setup`, `lib/privileges.sh`
**Approach:** Added Linux Mint version to Ubuntu codename mapping
- Mint 22.x → Ubuntu 24.04 (noble)
- Mint 21.x → Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy)
- Mint 20.x → Ubuntu 20.04 (focal)

**Result:** Still failed with same error

#### 2. System Cleanup
**Commands Executed:**
```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker*
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*docker*
sudo rm -f /usr/share/keyrings/docker*
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker*
sudo grep -i docker /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoclean
```

**Result:** Confirmed clean state, but error persisted

#### 3. Improved Fix (Commit 4fd78ec)
**Files Modified:** `privileged-setup`, `lib/privileges.sh`
**Approach:** Use `UBUNTU_CODENAME` from `/etc/os-release` with fallback to version mapping
```bash
# Primary method: Read UBUNTU_CODENAME from /etc/os-release
ubuntu_codename=$(grep '^UBUNTU_CODENAME=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2)

# Fallback: Version mapping if UBUNTU_CODENAME not found
```

**Result:** Still experiencing same error after system cleanup

#### 4. Discovery of UBUNTU_CODENAME
**Key Finding:** Linux Mint 22.1 provides `UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble` in `/etc/os-release`
- This is the correct Ubuntu codename that Docker repositories support
- Should eliminate need for manual version mapping

### Current Status
- Two commits pushed to fix the issue
- System cleanup performed on Linux Mint machine
- Error persists despite fixes
- User is updating Linux Mint system and rebooting before next test

### Next Steps
1. Test HOPS installation after Linux Mint system updates and reboot
2. If issue persists, investigate:
   - Whether updated code is actually being executed
   - Alternative installation paths being used
   - System-level caching preventing fix from taking effect
3. Consider manual repository configuration as verification step
4. Update changelog if fix is successful

### Technical Notes
- Linux Mint consistently provides `UBUNTU_CODENAME` in modern versions
- Using this field is more reliable than version-based mapping
- Docker installation uses Ubuntu repositories for Debian-based distributions
- Issue affects all Linux Mint installations using HOPS

### Files Modified
- `privileged-setup` (lines 43-70)
- `lib/privileges.sh` (lines 199-226)

### Git Commits
- `af57a77`: Initial Linux Mint version mapping fix
- `4fd78ec`: Improved fix using UBUNTU_CODENAME detection
